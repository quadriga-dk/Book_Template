# Ruff configuration for quadriga/ package
# See: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/
#
# Note: This configuration is primarily intended for the quadriga/ Python package.
# When running ruff on the entire repository, these rules will apply everywhere,
# but the ignore rules are tailored for the quadriga/ codebase specifically.
